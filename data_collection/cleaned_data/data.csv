#**DK 3-0 where?**,2021-11-07 00:51:17
"Through these two weeks, there is an interesting thing I observed. 
The post match game thread in which an LPL team won always receive less attention and discussions and praises than the ones in which they lost. 
Of course, there are some people , who will give the excuse that it is expected since LPL is a strong region. However, the notion seem to be contradictory to the comments I observed in the two post match threads that ‚Äú EDG WILL GET 3-0 by DK‚Äù in the very threads that EDG hard won their matches in two of BO5s during both Semi and Quarter finals. 
And it‚Äôs really sad that these type of comments are in a significant proportions. 
As for the other comments, they are either just, plainly downplay‚Äôs EDG‚Äôs opponents. And almost no one seems to care that EDG is a better team during these match ups. That if EDG won, these people seem to feel that their victory is not hard earned. It is not because EDG plays better it is just that EDG‚Äôs opponent are worse, and EDG plays bad.
I hope that this match serves as a wake up call, to all those who have been ridiculing LPL, ridiculing RNG, ridiculing EDG , just because none of your regions‚Äô team made it to the semi finals. You just need to trash talk, degrade, or plainly, to humiliate other region to get your copium and make you feel better.  
Give credit when credits are due. 
They earned it, and they deserve it.",2021-11-06 17:18:06

"What a series, never thought I‚Äôd see DK‚Äôs topside get gapped lol. The yasuo pick felt kinda troll, and the drafts all around felt weird from DK, trundle did nothing and you could see the hopelessness on canyon‚Äôs face, especially when he got killed before that baron fight up in the top lane. 

EDG played out of their minds as heavy underdogs tbh (which is ironic because they‚Äôre the first lpl seed). It‚Äôs like they saw what gave DK a hard time throughout all their games (only T1 won against them before but still), picked and chose what worked best in each situation and gave their best effort for it. 

Scout‚Äôs Zoe or his performance overall, jiejie gapping canyon, viper doing his thing like stomping with aphelios, flandre making khan look amateurish and meiko with the pivotal engages, Jesus Christ. DK looked great in their wins but I guess the 2-1 script buff is too strong. Really nice to go to 5 games tho, silver scrapes is always welcome, and just like the T1 semifinals, final game came down to an elder fight; absolute banger of a series. 

The first time EDG breaks their curse they win worlds, now that‚Äôs amazing in all honesty. Going into the finals I was kinda indifferent as to who I‚Äôd like to win, predicted 3-1 DK and was accepting that kkoma would get his 4th worlds before faker, with DK realizing a new dynasty for the LCK and khan getting his first international title but EDG came outta nowhere and proved me wrong. 

And that‚Äôs the thing: I was already thinking about DK, Khan and kkOma but never once thought about Scout and Meiko‚Äôs journey, together with their teammates, and how they just as much deserve a worlds championship as the aforementioned parties. Huge congratulations to EDG for overcoming their demons and breaking the curse, making their efforts all worth it.

Not gonna lie, it was saddening and kinda poignant, to see DK‚Äôs players‚Äô faces when they lost, but it is what it is. Having watched gbay99‚Äôs documentary on Scout, it all became more poetic for him to win this year imo. It was cool that he even mentioned that with this win against DK he avenged faker, and made me like him more as a player, seeing how he hasn‚Äôt forgotten his past experiences in SKT as a rookie etc., and used them to grow as a whole, player/person included (also how he talked about facing many obstacles and not performing at opportune times). Edit: also honorable mention for flandre saying he avenged SofM by beating DK, nice to see these players having good relations with other teams/players

Very proud of the EDG boys, a truly well-deserved victory. Taking revenge, destroying their curse, and burning DK‚Äôs chance at a dynasty all down (nice script btw). Consequently, flandre is also the first non-Korean/Chinese top/solo laner to have won worlds in the past 8 years, SKT‚Äôs back-to-back and 3 total worlds record is still untouched, and no one has had 4 worlds championships under their belt yet. Good stuff all around.",2021-11-06 18:29:36

BIG PROPS to  Viper, after all of the GRF drama he really deserved this  one.  The whole of EDG was sublime, especially Scout who played out of his mind. One hell of a worlds and congratulations again to EDG, now the third most accomplished LOL org ever with this worlds win today.

I'm half joking - cause more than half the times - improved vision was/is actually among the core differences between a win or a loss. The team with less vision (both map vision - and also - quite literally) - it's usually at disadvantage. Big time. That's the main thing i noticed - during this championship... where the players with better vision control - were usually the ones who secured a win for their team.",2021-11-06 17:58:12

idk why pick ziggs with syndra not the best comp,2021-11-07 08:12:01
"EDG finally got their redemption. They played well and were the stronger team. 

My thoughts: Honestly DK's drafts felt off throughout the series while EDG stuck to comfort. E.g. match 4 I thought DK's trade in the draft was pretty bad: they opened up Lucian and then 'denied' the Lucian/Nami pick and took Nami for themselves with Jhin. Just felt like a really odd 'changeup' and it felt like they didn't get anything especially good in return. I was also seriously questioning the Gwen and Talon pick - EDG's team comp is great at kiting back. Gwen is going to get kited and Talon has no diving buddy. At the end of the draft, EDG had Lucian, Graves, and Zoe - all strong and comfortable picks for EDG while DK was playing a basically new team comp while all of their trading got them a better botlane. Sure ghost and beryl got bottom tower first but that's basically all DK got, conceding mid and top pressure, and every neutral. Match 5, same thing, their draft was extremely questionable while EDG stuck to a standard comp with plenty of comfortable picks. Canyon got the 'counter' on Xin, but he was basically invisible again and blown up immediately in every single fight - and once more he was kited by everyone. Also while Trundle counters Xin, Xin soft counters ranged champions - DK had all ranged damage dealers and Xin escaped multiple times with ulti and only got punished once by the pillar. Meanwhile DK had 0 access to the backline and Aphelios - they were relying on mages to have any sort of threat on Aphelios (how was this ever going to work) which gets outscaled and are going to be more unreliable threats. So tl;dr for the last match; DK pick all ranged immobile damage dealers against Xin (counters ranged damage dealers) and Kennen (great against immobile squishies). DK had no way to kite, had no ability to kill Aphelios, and the cherry on top is that Scout got another Zoe game in. It wasn't hard to predict how this went given that EDG had been reaching the mid game without many problems against DK.",2021-11-07 09:20:52

"It's exciting and thrilling to see EDG win it all. But I also want to say, the team members of DK take their upset against EDG in a very positive way (Even from the prospective of a LPL supporter). This is sth that you barely see in eastern esports organisations. Like after every huge upset (2018 RNG vs G2, 2020 SN vs DWG), there are always full of flame and accusations. But Khan and his teammates are open-minded to their failure and their ""we don't regret cause we've tried our best"" attidude is so heartwarming.",2021-11-07 12:27:37

The supposedly best jungler in the world looked pretty average today.,2021-11-06 17:04:00
"While we did get 15 games in semis and finals this year, all three series followed the same pattern. Team A wins game one, loses game two and three and then wins games 4 and 5. Team A was EDG, DWG and EDG again. While having silver scrapes is exciting, it would be nice if they could vary the series a bit. 

RNG vs EDG was a nice change of pace, as RNG won the first game of that one and EDG still won in the end.

Memes aside, 5 game series are amazing, but I am heartbroken for both T1 and now DWG, especially Faker and Khan.",2021-11-06 17:04:00

DWG is stopped from starting their back to back runs at world championship.

"Teamfighting was pretty even, DW lost that game on macro. They were so confident in their teamfighting that they kept fighting. They literally wasted a Rift they could've used to stop EDG's 3rd drag, and Baron to stop soul. Instead, Khan decided to stop pushing with Baron FOR NO REASON to group up. Either send Syndra with TP bot to push, or have Khan hard commit to the split. Either they answer it and it's a free drag, plus mid turret, or since you have a Ziggs mid, just ignore Soul and destroy their base, and maybe send Leo and Trundle drag to try and steal/stop backs.

&#x200B;

That Baron should've guaranteed drag and river position, but instead they never pushed past river, conceded position, and played like they hadn't just snuck Baron.

"DW should've won game 5 if they did just 2 things right. One was NOT rift top for, what, an inner top turret they didn't even get? What does that really even accomplish in exchange for a drake that pushed EDG to soul point?

&#x200B;

The second was far worse. After bamboozling EDG with a brilliant Baron sneak, they then seemed to forget they had Baron. If you're down only 2k gold, have your core items,  soul point is coming up, but have Baron, you fucked up if the enemy team somehow has river priority. They either needed Showmaker pushing out bot, since he had TP and everyone else was mid, no wards or anything to threaten him, or Khan needed to push that huge wave past the river and start threatening turrets during the dragon countdown, not go mid like he was pushing a normal wave. 

&#x200B;

Regardless, the moment EDG had river position with a full summ Kennen sitting in base, the right decision was to hard push and send supp and jg to try to steal and interrupt backs. Ziggs could even do that WHILE pushing w/ ult. If Kennen committed to that TP, DW could've outright won the game if they stopped backs, or at least put themselves in a massive macro advantage. Regardless, they chose THE WORST possible situation possible, and it cost them the game.

&#x200B;

I don't know what it is with Korean teams and how they play dragon. I remember KT chunked out Xayah right as Infernal was spawning with the whole team mid, THEN LET HIM BACK AND GAVE iG POSITION ON WHAT WAS A OTHERWISE GUARANTEED DRAGON!

But looks at the picks EDG is showing - tried and tested, DK - first time Yasuo, Gwen in game 4, deny pick Graves without banning Kennen; Oriana in game 4 and trundle in game 5.

"Imagine hating on DK, cheering for EDG to win (Which they deservingly won), because DK won T1, denying T1's chance to ""Win another world championship"". They literally have 4 rookies that progress very well this year and they will be a force next year.

&#x200B;

I assure you if the semis was flipped and it was DK who win GenG, EDG who won T1. T1 fans would be rooting for DK instead, because in this case EDG ""denied T1's chance to win another world championship"". Ironic ain't it. Funny who T1 fans was calling for EDG to ""avenge/revenge for T1"" when they are literally a LPL team and one who has always rivalled T1 in internationals in the past/worlds (Even before ""SKT"" Scout's addition).

&#x200B;

And as for the Showmaker ""smug"" it was a joke and him having fun, too sad that fans this generation can't take jokes. I'm sure other players have this moment too, but why was it not mentioned? Because teams seldom kicked T1 out of contention, in the case DK did.

&#x200B;

EDG deserving to win anyway, DK heavily underperformed. But the way fans are reacting is absolutely childish and disgusting.

Today, World's Finals, the most important stream of the season and year I was a victim of him for no reason. Got banned just because he had an error with a player and chat was just letting him know. He got really mad and since the delay he just though my comments were just to bully him. My comment: ""Scout???"". BOOM. PERMA BANNED. 

So after being subbed and supporting him for two years he just blindly ban everyone just because he doesn't like to be corrected and thinks he's always right. He ruined the stream for me. He ruined the season. That's it for me with Dom. I don't know if it's the money or his success but he had change, or was always like this, I don't know. 

I hope you read this (beacause you take Reddit seriously) and maybe reflect on you actions in the future. I know you don't care you lost a sub and a follow (because why would you), but if you keep this attitude you'll keep losing your true fans. Wish you the best Dom.",2021-11-06 17:06:32

"Wtf was DW doing? They contested soul like they DIDN'T have Baron. Why the fuck was Khan pushing bot with no TP, rather than Syndra who had it? Let Syndra push and establish position for drag while still potentially regrouping, or have Khan hard push (they were in NO POSITION to collapse), forcing them to answer for free drag. Since they didn't decide that however, THEY ABANDONED THEIR HUGE MID WAVE TO CONTEST DRAG LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE BARON.

Seriously, let Khan keep pushing bot, let Ziggs keep pushing mid, and EDG is  fucked. Khan had no reason to group up, because if they go to answer his push, they get drag. Even after, he grouped up, they had 5 seconds and a huge wave mid while EDG had prio for drag. HAVE KHAN AND ZIGGS KEEP PUSHING. Who gives a shit if they get soul, they already made the wrong choice, and between Leo, Syndra, Trundle, and a Ziggs ult, they're gonna have a REAL hard time backing to save the base. 5 seconds for spawn, like 3 seconds to kill, and 8 seconds to recall. A Ziggs and Graves w/ a huge Baron wave vs a Kennen (who might've TP'd anyways) is going to give do MASSIVE damage to the base, and if they just stop recalls for 12 secs, they probably win. If not, doesn't matter if the rest of the team dies sacrificing themselves, they can't counterpush in time. Worst case scenario, and I do mean absolutely worse case, 3 deaths, and soul in exchange for an inhib. Best case scenario, they outright win. The proper decision would've been either Syndra bot with TP to join, or Khan keep pushing, forcing them to answer his split with more than one while they get drag.

&#x200B;

DW played that soul contest like they didn't have Baron, and that cost them the game. There was no guarantee they won that team fight, or the game on the Baron push, but there was a guarantee they at least would've secured a MASSIVE macro advantage at the cost of soul. Absolutely infuriating that they had such a clever Baron steal, yet straight up played after like they didn't have it.",2021-11-06 17:35:18

"If you are not native english speaker its easy imo, in my country like 90% of youngstrers can speak 3 languages freely. Older people know two languages, third would be english but other than taught in schools we have no use and noone around us speaks english so older people never learned it. So yeah for english native like, British and US 3 languages seems crazy but for others its kinda normal.",2021-11-07 03:28:24

fucking insane all the setup and flanks and engages",2021-11-06 17:22:32
Another banger black white Rakan skin incoming,2021-11-06 17:13:31

Meiko casually side stepping almost every skill shot thrown at him,2021-11-06 18:31:24
"I was SO disappointed when Meiko didn't win the MVP.. He or JieJie* deserved it thousand times more than Scout.

Also on top of those wonderful Rakan games, his first game on Zilean is what enabled Jarvan plays that ended up winning them the game",2021-11-06 20:02:14
The way he used his E in conjunction with his W was beyond orgasmic,2021-11-06 17:07:21
"I was disappointed every year by Meiko because he choked every year internationally. I'm so pleasantly surprised that the one year he didn't, he got a Worlds trophy. He deserves it.",2021-11-06 17:12:55
Meiko is too good in general. He played so well on all heros from Nami the hard disengage to Rakan the hard disengage.,2021-11-06 17:14:40
"On behalf of the three people who go crazy for vision games and scouting, I nominate Meiko for MVP of the series.",2021-11-06 17:17:47

Meiko was forever in enemy jungle relentlessly setting up vision. Insane.,2021-11-07 01:30:16
"Plus, the commentators made a good deal out of him constantly clearing and sheeting up vision for flanks and positioning for fights.",2021-11-07 04:59:51
Rakan this entire worlds has been carrying teams left and right. Tbh I think he low-key needs nerfs.,2021-11-06 17:15:06

I know itd be kinda lame to give FMVP to a jungler for the 4th year in a row but fuck Jiejie deserved it,2021-11-06 22:50:36
I think flandre graves ulting the small raptors while Canyon was taking them sums up that game nicely,2021-11-06 20:41:09
Scout also did a great job against Showmaker. EDG's mid and jg were def better this series,2021-11-06 21:46:40
Jiejie picked Viego but Canyon was the Ruined King.,2021-11-06 22:39:35
Jiejie actual smite god,2021-11-06 22:44:22
"I said it in groups and I'll say it again.  If you pick Talon jungle, you deserve to lose.",2021-11-07 01:14:28
"one has to recognize that canyon(or DK has a whole, we dont know) actually just trolled the entire team there by choosing to for an impossible bot dive instead of taking a free *infernal* drag(should be the choice every time, even if chance for succesful bot dive is 50% or higher), that wrong decision alone seriously swung the whole game in EDGs favor",2021-11-07 12:52:52
"??? Game 4 had nothing to do with JieJie running Canyon. Canyon actually played as you should in that scenario camping bot because top is an impossible gank with 0 cc vs a graves, and mid extremely hard vs a Zoe and easier to get counterganked and double killed if Xin zhao is nearby.

The problem was not how Canyon played but the pick itself. Talon (Poppy as well) are the most overrated junglers of the entire tournament.

Game 5 kennen got back because this tournament every team contest herald which is the most overrated objective even when they shouldnt. So imo its not worth at all to drop 300 g in a fight you are gonna lose vs Rakan/Xin zhao only to share some plating later. Hell DWG had some games in which the adc loses 2 waves and gives 2 platings for free just because he went to get herald. How is that even worth in the slightest.

JieJie didnt play bad but wasnt amazing either. Meiko on the other hand was the most consistent player of the series imo and worth MVP. Flandre and Viper played also pretty well and Scout just got carried in a lot of games. He barely could land bubbles it was painful if you compare him to BDD which actually knew how to Zoe spam. But in the end the series got decided by DWG getting outdrafted harder. Specially game 5 DWG comp really had no synergy at all and Aphelios could just run wild specially with some items.",2021-11-07 02:13:39

Damwon was crowned World champs and the next dynasty right after beating T1. EDG wasn't even given a chance; not from other LoL pros/creators, not from the analysts, and definitely not from this sub. EDG responded by pulling perhaps the biggest finals upset yet in one of the best finals ever.

"Man finally did it after all the suffering in Snake. Meiko finally did it for his teammates in S5... His post in Weibo, posting the whole S5 EDG picture winning MSI is...just too fking wholesome, you can't not root for the guy.

Honestly, this EDG win is so good for league, they deny DK building their Worlds dynasty and 2nd Worlds trophy. This win also is so sweet since many ""analysts"" think they were gonna get 3-0'd. I knew they'd get underestimated like 2019 FPX but man their resilience in 1-2 series has been most impressive.",2021-11-06 18:27:22

Yeah like Beryl was the problem for DK today,2021-11-06 17:05:16
Was it really BeryL though? Canyon messed up but more importantly Aphelios is just a better ziggs with the AOE damage and DWG didn't have the Zoe to blow him like against T1. Showmaker also shouldn't be running predator still,2021-11-06 17:05:43

"Pro league doesn't work like that though. Just like Canyon gets to look a lot better when his lanes do well, almost all of a junglers success comes from team coordination, strategy and good laning on their team. You'd have to spend hours analysing the VOD to try to find out what exactly happened this series, for Damwon just did not look like themselves. Something EDG did across their entire team really shut them down. That's not Canyon being ""gapped"", it's EDG playing better than Damwon as a team. You can't invade a blue buff without the entire team playing around it.",2021-11-07 13:33:16
Honestly both Scout and Jiejie were the better Mid/Jg duo this series. They played out of their minds and Jiejie got so many steals from Canyon,2021-11-06 17:23:49

Ziggs is super oppressive if you can get ahead.  You can have your support roam and make plays while he farms under tower.  That opens up opportunity to get a lead and then you just have Ziggs push down towers to get more gold and accelerate ahead.  Problem is DWG never got a lead in game 5.  It is one of the champions where sometimes it looks like it is impossible to win against and other times looks like it is impossible to win with.,2021-11-06 17:23:09
"Ziggs is mainly good for zone control/wave clear and poking out squishies (the turret thing sometimes I guess). Essentially gaining a hp advantage in a given situation.

This worked against T1 because their team (both team's comps) allowed for it, but it was evident from game 1 that the lack of an adc's constant dps pressure was a major weak point against EDG.

I was confused as to why they didn't make Zoe a priority for Showmaker if they wanted to run Ziggs. You kinda need to go all in on a hard poke comp. You also need an appropriate follow-up to clean up who you've chunked out.

Though while I am unhappy with a few of DWK's drafts (would rather watch both teams at full potential duke it out than having DWK weakening their comp with a weird pick), this was such a fun series to watch.",2021-11-06 18:03:30
Ghost needs to dodge match ups because he is a T3 adc,2021-11-06 20:34:21

LOL esports loses more money than DOTA esports. All of the LOL leagues around the world lose money except LPL. DOTA doesn't have leagues, they have a tournament format, so Valve doesn't lose money operating them. These leagues are expensive to run due to the sheer amount of staff needed to make them possible, and the revenue does not outweigh the expenses except in China.

I feel like the games could've went a lot differently if Canyon made it a point to threaten mid. Props to EDG though because they were ahead all of the early games (even when the got stomped 22-3) from what I recall. Casters never really acknowledged how well Scout was playing (especially that Ryze-Leblanc matchup that he was crushing), and that irked me because they would mention Showmaker even as Showmaker was being battered by Scout.",2021-11-06 20:33:51

The grammar, syntax, writing system etc are all different.

A lot of people can speak Mandarin and bad English; speaking both fluently is by itself rare. Add Korean to that and it's very impressive. It's not at all comparable to speaking Flemish, French and English, or something like that.",2021-11-06 18:16:22

Khan should have played better tbh. For some reason he looked only good on Graves during the T1 games and against EDG despite how he played in groups and against MAD,2021-11-06 17:08:35

"For me it was full copium that RNG is now the 2nd best team at worlds COPIUM

I really love rng but they didn't adapt well to the meta, I really thought xiaohu would loves graves top since they can play around it like they do around lucian but I guess not. Also the botlane not being comfortable picking yuumi and having trouble playing against it.

Still I think they played quite well overall",2021-11-07 18:44:26

"I mean let's take the context first. EDG was REALLY underperforming up to expectation (Viper/Meiko best botlane in the world didn't show itself at all), they fought two teams considered weaker than them and didn't look that impressive during theses two series.
During that time, Dawmong looked untouchable and like a ruthless cold machine. They had an insane semi final against the dark horse T1 who finally got their footing and had insane players mechanically.

Explain to me why people would think after semi finals that theses teams where on the same level? Dawmong wasn't just strong, they looked INCREDIBLY dominant, something we didn't saw for years now.

It is as if FNC went out of group at first after the whole upset situation and people said ""LOL HOW COULD YOU HAVE DOUBT THAT FNC WOULD BE FIRST"".

"There are about 8 junglers in total, 4 top tier picks of Lee Sin, J4, Xin Zhao, Qiyana, and 4 kinda okay-ish but can't really draft in most games with Talon, Viego, Poppy, Olaf. Everything else is just unpickable. Same with the ADC role, Lucian, MF, Aphelios, Jhin, maybe Draven/Ezreal or bust. Ziggs as the AP choice for bot but otherwise about 5 actual pickable bot laners.

This is probably the least diverse worlds in History, only 63 unique picks & bans across the 29 games of Quarters + Semis + Finals. About 40% of the champion pool even worth touching, and a good chunk of those 63 champs were picked like once or banned and never picked at all. The top 8 teams in the world are only interested in dealing with 40% of the champ pool, the remaining 60% is that un-meta and unpickable. No counterpicks, no individual good enough at one champion to draw a ban. It's just both teams drafting the same composition using the same small pool of champions for the entirity of the knockout stage. What a fucking disappointment. Idk how the casters could even talk through pick-ban stage, it's so predictable and similar every single fuckin game.",2021-11-06 17:29:16

"Uzi has MSI and his team was never that strong. What made Uzi's team super team was the fact he was on them. Every single one of his teams had some glaring flaws and relatively weak players (usually solo laners)

Yep. It is safe to say that Khan is probably the biggest anti-clutch player/choker ever. How on earth do you go to multiple world champion calibur rosters and never win a world championship? I hate to say it but it only happens if the player is not good and Khan is not a world champion calibur player.

- hopping to world champion team and losing the next year

This is one of the most comprehensive curses I've ever seen in lolesports history.

Khan award should replace the dade award now to keep up with modern times.",2021-11-06 18:48:02
First time a CN top has won worlds tho,2021-11-06 18:10:54
"- Khan curse remains

> LCK still looks better than LPL overall.

Hard to tell, RNG won MSI, and barely won LPL in spring. LPL was touted as the best region coming in and clearly misread the meta/choked in the case of FPX.

If you mean LCK was the best region at worlds? yes.

If you mean you expect LCK to continue to be ""best region"", not really, EDG came out of a competitive region where every team was close.",2021-11-06 18:52:06
"i mean we have our 2nd seed implode really hard

and our 4th seed not really performing as expected.

it just unfortunate that we got EDG v RNG",2021-11-06 17:09:30
"I think nobody expected FPX to fucking implode like that and EDG had low moments which made everyone underestimate them. Scout can be amazing or int and in the finals he was on fire.

"I think what this world's did was show that LCK isn't a 'one team region' though, and LCK did still have 3 teams in semifinals. So I think this showed that both the one team statements and the overrated statements after week 2 have been wrong.",2021-11-06 17:11:28
I still think some people were a bit optimistic about the LPL. FPX shit the bed in groups and LNG just wasn‚Äôt good enough to make it out. EDG and RNG are world class teams but IMO Korea was still better this time. Not by a huge margin but still. Anyone who predicted DK 3-0 is an idiot though.,2021-11-06 17:11:15
"LCK still has significantly more talent than any other region. No one is importing LPL players and the only LPL teams to win worlds were 40% Korean. Not downplaying the Chinese players on EDG this year, I think each of them played a major factor in their win unlike IG's win, but when 17 of the final 20 players are Korean, it's pretty obvious where all the talent is. Sure LPL can buy top Korean talent, but they will really struggle to develop young talent with the new gaming bans and they had a large talent gap to begin with. Hell even SofM was an import for Suning and he was their main carry.

If we're talking ability to form teams and coaching ability LPL is certainly not overrated (especially with how hard DWG got draft gapped each game), but the region's talent gap is pretty large compared to Korea.

If we're talking availability of homegrown talent, LPL is overrated as fuck. If EU committed to Korean talent as hard as China has to fill in gaps, they would overtake the LPL by a mile.",2021-11-06 17:12:46

Super curious as to why they didn‚Äôt lock in zoe right there. Showmaker locked it directly it after the Leona, implying to me they 100% did not want to play against that. Did Damwon just overthink that? Assuming EDG had an answer when they were happy to just steal Zoe? Super interesting stuff that‚Äôll likely never get an answer :(

"*Everything* is not fun play against. If they weren't, they'd be worthless. There's no such thing as ""fun to play against"". People need to stop acting like there is.

* The enemy locks me down with crowd-control? Not fun to play against.
* The enemy deals a lot of damage to me? Not fun to play against.
* The enemy is tanky enough to withstand all of my damage? Not fun to play against.
* The enemy is evasive and can engage on me? Not fun to play against.
* The enemy is stealthy and kills me before I can retaliate? Not fun to play against.

But guess what? It doesn't matter if something is ""not fun to play against"". What matters is if the person playing it finds it fun.

&#x200B;

Consider this: do you play the game so your ***opponents*** have fun? Do you think they're having fun when you eliminate them? Deny their plays?

Come mid-late game they are not strong but if they have a lead, it's hard to lose those teamfights.

"Those titles are team accolades. As great as he is, as cracked as he is, even though he played out of his mind this series, I find it hard to give Scout that much credit when you look at the pieces he was playing with. He got to play with who a lot of people considered the best jungler in the world for a loong time. He got to play with one of the most well respected supports in the league. And I think most people at \*\*worst\*\* would put Viper top 3 ADC in the world. I think I'm being too generous here too. I think most people wouldn't put Viper below top 2, but that's besides the point.  

What I guess I'm trying to say is, it's understandable to get underappreciated when you have these superstars all around you out shining the fuck out of you.  

It also doesn't really help that the one guy that you couldn't get playing time over when you first started playing competitively, is still playing, and is still better than you.",2021-11-06 21:23:07

">free summoners from minions are a mistake

Spell Shards are not free. Zoe earns each and every Spell Shard that she gets.

She can collect Spell Shards one of two ways: first, by waiting the arrival for a minion with a balloon (less than one per wave), successful delivering the last hit on said minion, then going over to collect the Shard; or second, by one dropping from someone on the enemy team, and then going over to collect the Shard. The Spell Shard is right there on the ground for everyone to see. Going over to it sets Zoe up for the enemy team's crowd-control, area-denial, skill-shots, point-and-click abilities, and even their basic attacks. It's basically a beacon that says ""Zoe will try to collect this. Punish her for it!""

Please take note of that second way of collecting Shards. Enemies drop them by casting Summoner Spells or triggering item-actives. That means that by simply not using those while Zoe is around, the enemy team can deny Zoe a lot of her potential power. I doubt there is another Champion in the game whose power is so closely linked to the actions of the enemy team. And here's something to consider: Summoner Spells and item-actives are just about the only actions that are truly only in the player's control. There are abilities that force you to move, force you to attack, force you to keep still, but no one can force you to use those. If Zoe collected a Spell Shard from you, it means not only did you trigger your ability while she was near enough to get it, you also did it in a place that was safe for her to collect it, and no one on your team stopped her from collecting it.

So what does Zoe get for her efforts? One cast of Spell Thief. Think about that for a moment. Bard collects randomly spawning Chimes (that he doesn't need to make spawn, nor can they be withheld by the enemy), and when he does, he gains experience and empowers his Meeps. Collecting his randomly spawning collectible makes him scale. And don't get me started on Thresh. Randomly spawning souls grant him Ability Power, Armor, Shield strength, and damage on his Flay ability. This is on top of fact that these will spawn simply from things dying near Thresh (while Zoe needs to last-hit her minions), cannot be seen by enemies unless they have vision of Thresh, and most amusing of all, they can be collected by his Lantern. Zoe's collectible, which must be earned by her directly and can be withheld by enemies, grants her one cast of an ability, while Champions who have an easier time gathering their collectibles get to scale.

And by the way, they get to do this... without sacrificing an ability slot! Spell Thief already has a greater price than most Champions can imagine: having a ""W"" ability. Let's consider, for example, Yasuo: another Champion with a very powerful ""W"" ability. Imagine if suddenly Yasuo players were told that, in order to cast your ""W"", you will first have to earn the right to cast it by collecting a drop, then you have to use it within the next minute or it'll go to waste, you're not allowed to stack multiple of them, which means you'll have to go through this each and every time you want to use this ability, and in the meantime, this slot is effectively empty. They would go into shock. But that's Zoe's reality.

Then in the final EDG actually get the upset and defeat DWG who I found to be playing below the level they showed throughout the tournament.

DK played really poorly today, with some really questionable draft choices (Trundle jg, Nami without Lucian), and EDG definitely were the better team on the day, but I don't think the thought that if DK won EDG might have been the 3rd best team was really that ridiculous. Rather I think the format being super garbage meant we had 0 clue that EDG was this good before literally the finals, as they played teams viewed as much weaker than T1/DK coming up to the finals (GenG which lost handily to T1 in playoffs, RNG who barely beat out HLE in groups) and barely beat them, meanwhile T1 and DK stomped every team they faced, dropping exactly 1 game to EDG in groups, only to have a super close semifinal series, and looked far and away the best. The fact that EDG clutched the win today is an amazing feat, but this was a single Bo5, and given how close it was, it's hardly deterministic of which team is overall better (remember if LPL was Bo5 single elimination we would have concluded that EDG was worse than WE by the same logic, something clearly not true given more games).",2021-11-06 17:21:54

"> didn't see champ select game 5, just realized 66% WR Jhin was open. Why the fuck didn't they pick him? Holy shit

Because EDG had already picked Aphelios, who is strong into Jhin, and DK didn't want to draft an intentionally losing bot lane. The Ziggs pick obviously didn't look too great, but in theory it's a low risk option that can go even or better into Aphelios in lane.

"Can't really disagree with that either, haha. But hey, that's what makes this team so awesome. No obvious weak link, they all played really well. Sometimes specific players really stood out, other times they were ""just"" good. But they're so fun to watch, especially when they're playing so confident. How Meiko was just wandering around the enemy jungle, basically surrounded by 5 enemies. warding and removing vision. The way Viper really took off on Lucian with the Lulu buffs and how he kept dashing/flashing forward, that positioning! How Flandre can farm and farm and then suddenly it's ""oops, wtf, he's level 18??"" JieJie with his private lessons from Clid on how to never lose smite fights.  And Scout, who never really gets talked about much when people talk about the best midlaners in the world.. Even after his phenomenal showing in 2018 (Caps who? :D) people kinda ignored that due to their defeat. It's always Showmaker this, Chovy that, Rookie, Faker, etc. He finally showed them! And I have to say one of the greatest parts of this entire series was how they managed to completely kill off Canyon's Talon. He didn't stand a chance. It was such a great team effort. At end game there, Canyon was level 13 and Flandre was 18 on his Graves. Poor Canyon, but I loved how they managed to do that.

Can't really put into words why, but I always felt the LPL had such amazing playstyle. Even during the SKT era, I never really liked the slow macro playstyle. I mean, it was super good, super surgical and impossible to play against right? But it's just so much less fun to watch. The explosive LPL style was always a joy to watch. But what EDG does shows such an understanding of macro play, their vision, jungle pathing, teamfight positioning, I love all of it. And I couldn't be happier that they finally showed what they're capable of. They were always good, they always had high ceilings, but it never showed at Worlds. FINALLY. EDG EDG EDG!

Edit: wow sorry, I didn't mean for it to become this wall of text. I blame EDG, they made me happy. :D",2021-11-07 09:40:13

I don't think it's so easy to say that 100T was a bad team. TL and C9 played decent and 100T is probably better than them if they didn't have to face the eventual T1 and the eventual champions.,2021-11-06 23:38:19
"This is a bad opinion. 100T literally played with T1- 3 times world champions and once again, a favorite to win worlds along with Damwon. They beat EDG - the current World Champion who fought it out bitterly against all odds - and Detonation FocusMe - the strongest wildcard atm and had many people drooling over them since MSI.   


If losing to a team like 100T is bad... Then what is even good? I think besides the deluded EU fans everybody knows 100T has a worlds contention roster and is the best western team by far, just that... their luck is very poor much like NA's every year who had to run into either the eventual winner or HUGE favorites right from the get-go",2021-11-07 03:28:52

"Casuals honestly or watching too much of DOM. I mean there's no way I can prove it to you unless you scroll through my comments but as someone who pays close attention to LPL, I've been on the EDG train since they were dominating LPL summer going 8-0 in regular split and news of Doinb saying EDG being an unbeatable team due to reasons you can't easily replicate:

- incredibly wide champion pool
- strong teamfight synergy, we're talking about synchro levels, they read each other's minds in the middle of teamfights
- overall strong individual players who have a strong identity when combined, heck, these 5 dudes look similar

Meanwhile FPX:

- Tian suffers from depression and poor health
- DoinB wants to reitre
- Bo matchfixing
- Nuguri wants to go back to Korea, sick of China

The signs were all there yet people still believed in them. And this is not to mention:

In LPL playoffs:

- FPX behind in nearly every game, even the games they win - weak early game
- Relies on doinb solocarry (not a reliable strategy)
- lost finals (big surprise, the #1 LPL seed is better than #2)

"1. Hey thats not fair. I would argue that worlds 2017 was the bigger choke as RNG at MSI... just had plot armor.
2. Canyon and Showmaker are still super good and prolly the best players at their roles atm. One overperformance from Jiejie shouldnt discredit all they did in the entire year. Scout was just underrated imho he is not significantly worse than Showmaker, but Showmaker is still a class above him.  


EDG showed up on the day with better prep. Thats all. Me and all the LPL gang knew their full peak but their consistency is very mediocre. Damwon had a lower peak BUT their consistency is no 1 in the world atm. One bad day doesnt take away what Damwon had achieved in the year : 2 LCK titles, 1 game away from being MSI Champions and 1 game away from being worlds champions",2021-11-07 04:09:11

People were barely starting to praise LPL that they completely collapse round 2. Come the bracket stage, EDg was expected to get eliminated (because they always do) and they still got through. People were expecting them to lose to DK badly and they win.

The only expectation that was more or less on point was that western teams wouldn't go far once they showed they performance in groups.",2021-11-06 17:52:35
"Basically. It's not like the toxic rivalry started this worlds, it's been there on both sides (+ bandwagoners who still prefer EU/NA first) ever since it became a real rivalry with LPL winning 2018 and 2019. But then even after Damwon emerged to win 2020 the talk was still just about LCK being a one team region while LPL gets hyped as having all their top 4+ teams capable of winning worlds lmao. Not that the MSI results and how fast new teams+players emerge (and burn out) in China help with that, but sheesh. Does it have to be repeated everywhere and for any other LCK team but also Damwon themselves even? And why is people underrating EDG going into this based on their games before this different from people underrating LCK as a whole before Worlds?

It's like not even winning Worlds will shut up the people who are so into supporting the new ""best region"" they just want to shit on everyone else, or other region fans who want to bring the LCK down to their level. Exactly why I am not looking forward to following anything until MSI or Worlds + Asian Games next year might change things again.

But considering this Worlds result with LCK being the ones having 3 teams in semis and cannibalizing each other to lose 2-3 in finals vs LPL in 2020 having 2 teams in semis and cannibalizing each other to lose 1-3 in finals, LPL is the one team region now and LCK is still stronger as whole, right? Yet somehow I doubt that will be the narrative that will be remembered or spread. :)",2021-11-06 19:01:52

I don't want to harp on people for predicting wrong, but when it comes to predictions, you must consider the intangibles, think outside the box.

I mean some people saw EDG's ceiling, and knew they had a chance of reaching a ceiling that is higher than DK.

Some people saw how EDG plays better when they are underdogs, and chokes vs teams perceived as ""weaker"", as shown in LPL and in the GenG series where people predicted 3-1 EDG (on average).

Some people saw EDG as a team that play extremely well as a unit, and have a wide champion pool, both of these are not easily replicated.

Better draft means players can play better... You can give them credit for drafts as well... it's not just the driver it's also the car.

"They were formed as the ""traitor team"".  WE was super popular at the time because it's an old club and they had China's best results at the time, going on a massive win streak, winning many tournaments both domestic and international, and winning IPL 5.  Eventually they declined and Misaya retired, and Clearlove + Fzzf were basically always fighting with Caomei and Weixiao (their most popular player and considered to be the best ADC in the world before Uzi and Namei).  Coach Aaron, who was important enough to have even gone with them to take their trophy on stage at IPL5, took Clearlove and Fzzf with them to form EDG, and took Namei, who by that time was China's best ADC and probably the world's, who just carried his shitter team to an LPL championship.  He got a lot of hate too, I'm not sure why, but maybe because his team, PE, was originally WE's sister team.  Namei is one of three players who's gotten 3 LPL titles in a row (Clearlove and Koro1), and the only player to have gotten 4 finals in a row and still has more titles than any other ADC, so that pickup was *huge* for them.  Then these ""traitors"" win LPL over their golden boy WE, but have disappointing worlds results.

"If you're mentioning those champs because of the LS tier list, the real issue is that not many AD mids are really playable.

Tryndamere turned out to be somewhat of a flop, and they removed a lot of power from Lucian mid. After that we get things like Graves mid, who I don't know if Worlds mid laners were playing (he feels pretty sad into mages anyway), Tristana (extremely hard countered by Syndra), and a bunch of AD assassins that lose a lot of agency after 15 minutes in competitive play.

Even though Magic pen is strong, going double AP mid/jg makes the 2v2 harder since both other mid/jg will have more MR (namely Merc Treads) which makes your damage take a lot longer to come online.

I'm specifically talking about playing to the level they were literally just playing at.

"Last year China had 3 out of 4 teams out of groups and 2 in semis after having to cannibalize each other + 1-3 in finals. This year Korea had 4/4 teams out of groups, 3 in semis after having to cannibalize one of their own and 2-3 in finals. That's actually a better result even, but still losing compared to just winning the final. 

Yet for some reason I'm certain no one will call the LPL a ""one team region"" or remember them as such. The power of how narratives are applied differently depending on biases and how they are first formed. 

And LPL's talent turnover of new teams and players being faster, to be fair, but with the end result of them also burning out by the next international tournaments. Credits to EDG for actually making history and breaking the mold by having an older and more established team+players in that sense, but we'll have to see if that lasts now.",2021-11-06 18:41:20
"I agree, on the one hand going through the post match threads can be funny, but on the other hand it's annoying to have to scroll through the endless LCK/LPL comments (depending on who won). There are a variety of villains inhabiting these comment sections usually.

Still, I can't help but feel really bad for Khan, and quite disappointed that DK's prime was over too soon this tournament. Still, EDG has improved massively as well between semis and the final, and it's nice to see them that happy about winning - even though I still feel worse about Khan not being able to win",2021-11-06 17:27:43

"2018 just no dude, not what happened.",2021-11-06 17:11:04

2021 is the weird one. We're in a general era of LPL dominance, even if it isn't as consistent as the era of LCK dominance. Damwon had roster changes since their worlds win, and failed to win MSI. They hadn't matched up against any LPL teams at worlds aside from a collapsing FPX that had also lost to Rogue and C9. Their quarter and semi final matchups were against an EU team that they'd already beaten at MSI, and the 3rd place team from their own league. These aren't achievements that should imply an automatic favourite. EDG didn't have great accomplishment's either, but I think at the moment you need to give the benefit of the doubt to LPL teams.",2021-11-06 19:05:06

"DK only had 1 easy playoff match.

Also, EDG had to play against RNG whereas DK played against Mad Lions.",2021-11-07 00:33:25
"

So not fair. EDG played vs RNG - who is literally the current MSI champion atm and GENG - who just dominated MAD Lions and C9 with all guns blazing looking for a repeat of 2017. In groups they lost to T1 and 100T who are pretty much top 4/6 teams in the world atm.  


Meanwhile Damwon only has to beat a dogshit MAD Lions, barely scraped past T1 who has more rookies than NA has Americans at worlds !. Not even mention their shitty groups with bad/choking teams lying all around.

"Finals rarely have elements of surprise, and comfort picks for players are very critical to calm their nerves. In the last week of Worlds, there were no legit scrim partners left for both contenders to try out new things against what they've seen in semis. 

So teams had to choose between playing comfort picks then hoping they can absorb pressure and counterpicking a champion which isn't polished in pro play. It becomes a matter of adaptation more than innovation.

In the end EDG were the better team at adapting. Meiko's Zilean and Khan's Yasuo were both counterpick strategies copied from T1's book, but Meiko made it work while Khan flopped. DK tried their 'counterpick' and failed, so they dared not and had no wiggling room to attempt a second time.",2021-11-07 07:33:17

"Typically if you pay people the most, then it is the best region. It attracts the most talent and finest competition. The NBA, MLB, and NHL are the finest leagues in the world in their sports, pay the most money, AND they attract the best talent. Talent-wise, I think LPL is right there with LCK but I think a lot of fans get it confused. Chinese fans get it twisted because they think the best players of their leagues are also Chinese. . . Which they aren't. They're Koreans. If you look at the LPL as a whole and rosters with Korean players on them, they're typically the best players on the team if not the whole league. 

&#x200B;

The concept of 5 Chinese never winning worlds is a comment that makes a lot of Chinese LPL fans butthurt. Scout is a top5 mid laner in the world and Viper is undisputed King of ADC right now. Doinb is a superstar and hard carried that team consistently and TheShy/Rookie were the stars of IG as well. I genuinely don't think 5 Chinese win worlds any time soon, but LPL as a region is very strong nonetheless. 

I know butthurt Chinese fans are going to downvote me for this but it's certainly not a wrong assessment. I don't think US players are the best hockey players because I'm American and the NHL is the best league. In fact, I think the nation is a good 3rd place after Canada and Russia.

Jungle-reliant Carry toplaner,

Supporting Mid-laner,

Agressive top-focused Jungler,

Good weakside ADC

Heavy-roam support.

Fit the meta really well, which means that it's easier to win

But next years worlds, maybe ADC and Midlane are the main carries

Your toplaner will now either have to adapt to those resources being given to someone else, or fail

Your midlaner will have to adapt to agressive/carry-focused play

Your jungler might need to become more passive/bot-focused

Your support would probably need to be with the ADC more, since the ADC now needs as much resources as possible

and the good weakside play of the ADC will now have to become good carry play.

Of course, I don't know if this applies to the Champions EDG, as I'm quite unfamiliar with the LPL in general, but with the addition of Chemtech and Hextech dragons to the game, I think the bottom lane will rise in priority, as both of those dragon souls are really strong.

"""EDG win finals: they're lucky, because based on stats they should've lost; EDG lose finals: expected, according to stats. There is not a single scenario in which EDG win because they were the better team, according to stats hyperbolic bullshit"". 

You are cherry picking some mentalities that to me, make little to no sense. 

I would, and in my mind, I predicted a 3-0 for DWG. Based on performance from both teams. I watch the games, I understand the game, I can make some rational judgement on what will happen. That's one of the cores of what makes a Human, Human. Assuming, Judging, expecting something to happen based on past results. I expect my spaghetti to be rolled in the fork, if I've done it a thousand times. There's a lot to say about cognitiveness, physics bla bla bla, but it's engrained in us that intelligence isn't some magical stuff, it's knowing and rationalizing stuff out. Anyway....

The cherry picking hypothetical sentences on both scenarios, to me it's borderline people who are basing their predictions on emotions. Which is 100% valid. But it's up to you, me, and everyone to make a clear distinction weather it's a rational or emotional prediction. In doubt, ask why that prediction.

Most predictions are based on emotions here at Reddit. Want to break that cicle? A strengths and weaknesses thread of both teams is always appreciated. There are sometimes a few by very smart people who make strong arguments (in my eyes), and they are enjoyable to see. It gives, at least to me, a moment to learn, and insights into changing how I play, how I watch the game and how I predict results.

EDG also had a disappointing Groups so it felt like they were just going to crash as usual. It isn‚Äôt as outlandish as you‚Äôd think it is so I don‚Äôt know why you should pin such a stupid sense of responsibility onto someone‚Äôs Pickems.",2021-11-06 18:22:02
If anything i'd argue this DWG vs EDG series came down to EDG doing their homework (taking away zoe in g5 while also limiting Canyon's pool) while DWG underestimated EDG by first timing Yasuo (lost a game of it to t1) but literally had no idea how to play around it. (not trying to take anything away from EDG's win btw). was nice to have a 5 game finals after such a long time.,2021-11-06 18:02:39

"Gwen has a kit that makes her very strong in enclosed spaces such as the jungle entrances to river, allowing her to hold off multiple members of the opposite team alone. This means that as long as the other team is funnelled into these chokepoints its very hard for them to actually get to important objectives like baron or dragon. The issue is that in game 4, DK looks like they just lost control of the game, letting EDG getting free dragons. Hence, if you're not there to hold them off, then Gwen becomes so much less threatening and the strategy falls apart.",2021-11-07 00:49:10

"Not really, when you pick Fiddle into Talon, it's an act of begging Talon to invade your jungle the whole game, even your Graves top laner can't do a shit about it. Most of the time, Talon is a champion that can invade without being punished thanks to his 0s cooldown E. Yes you can tell your team to come in your jungle and help, but at what cost? When minions and exp are lost, they're lost forever. You can't just babysit a Fiddle entire game and you know that when you come, Talon can simply just press E 2 times and get to the river. That's a waste of time, gold, turret plates and exp with a very low chance of being able to catch a Talon.",2021-11-07 04:27:48

"Yes, they are a thing, but you do need some frontline in a professional team. If you pick a mage in the jungle, you need to play a more tanky champion in a solo lane, which loses you a ton of pressure. You also don't clear as fast or healthy on a majority of mages, you get invaded and one-shot, you can't contest crab 1v1, you have no escape and so you can't really invade, you suck at skirmishing so you struggle with that... bruiser or assassin junglers are just a much safer and consistent way to play the game.",2021-11-07 13:20:50
"Across quarters, semis and finals there was 1 AP jungle pick in Gragas and it lost. Besides that it's been one of those 3 AD itemization choices for the 29 games, AP itemization is just that much worse than AD for junglers right now. Mid mages are fine and so is Kennen, but Jungle is AD items ONLY. DK outdrafted themselves by banning Viego in game 5 and letting Xin through, leaving them with Poppy, Olaf or Talon as their only remaining jungle choices. Since none of those seemed any good to pick, and with Xin picked and the other 4 junglers (Lee, J4, Qiyana, Viego) banned, they had no options so they troll-picked Trundle and lost the finals on it. They really should have let Viego go through, let EDG get pick of Xin vs Viego and then DK takes the other. If EDG bans Xin/Viego as last ban, DK bans the other and they fight over the Poppy/Olaf/Talon tier picks.",2021-11-06 18:01:56
"Again, pro League isn't your random solo queue game where you can just blindside the other team with a Fiddle because the other players are too stupid to respect a random crow ult. Pro League might as well be its own game because it is.

"MSI has had format issues, like 2016 where RNG got punished for placing higher than CLG, but it's not a ""Not serious tournament"", teams put in serious work too.

If you're just buying the best players of course you're going to have the best results. 34% of LPL players aren't from the region (coming very close to the 40% limit).

2: I've only seen people use MSI as a talent measurement as a joke, so please tell me you're not being serious.

"> If you look at MSI results and put them in context, they are pretty useful.

In what context? Because I would argue quite the opposite. The only team to have consistent results at MSI with worlds has been SKT.

SKT in 2015 got 2nd at MSI but won worlds. In 2016 they won both MSI and worlds. In 2017 SKT won MSI but got 2nd at worlds, losing to a team that didn't even make it to MSI.

In 2018 RNG won MSI but failed to make semis.

In 2019 Liquid got 2nd at MSI but didn't make it out of groups, and G2 won MSI but got 2nd.

2021 RNG once again won MSI but failed to make semis.

MSI has had 7 top 4s from the NA, PCS, and SEA regions. At worlds it has only happened once (cloud9 in 2019) since MSI started.

The Flash Wolves have had massive success at MSI making it to Semifinals 3 times and Quarterfinals once, but at worlds have only made it to quarterfinals once and either flubbed out in groups or didn't even make it to worlds after performing fantastic at MSI.

I really don't see any context that makes MSI look like it's a useful measurement.",2021-11-06 18:24:13

"Everything is discussed.

Except for where you think league is a variable game. Everything is. The fork might break, weaken itself. There variables are less changing and way less dynamic. It does not mean you can't predict something with it. Even the amount of spaghetti strings.

League is indeed dynamic. Like everything else in this world. I've a degree in Statistics, I do know what I'm talking about here.

My whole education converges to Data Science tho. We can have systems that have high orders of complexity, and still make some solid educated guessing. Read, educated guessing, which to the generic folk, it's ""prediction"".

We can argue if knowing all the variables, the system outcome is deterministic or not. (Hint: unless all our current theory on Quantum Mechanics is wrong and we need a new Einstein or Feynman, no system is deterministic). But, the statistical significance of these non deterministic variances is arguably null in the grand scheme of, let's say, a League of Legends game.

I may have to do guessing on whether a player will kill a creep on 3:33 or 3:34, due to the probabilistic nature of reality, but there are strong beliefs that that slight difference will have little impact.

It's the same as expecting that an absurd amount of these slight changes results in my coffee shop down the road team will win vs Real Madrid.

Here, in this case, the match up was more evenly matched. Yet, League has developed enough for good Human scouting and judging. Imagine then what algorithms can spit out in terms of performance and quality. They ""see"" shit we can't even dream of.

Of course these algorithms are rudimentary since they don't, 1) account for player mood; 2) player history to the adversary; 3) any other human related factor that doesn't involve the ""League of legends"" domain. (See case: Bwipo); 4) account for interactions between different players (We are going into psychology levels here. Want a good guess or know about this? Talk with Casting people for reality shows, check their backgrounds); 5) Player styles; 6) Many other little things.

Nowadays these little algorithms look at what they can get, but I think currently, humans who know the shit they are talking about (Casters, analysts, LS etc etc) are the best guestimates/predictions we can have before a game.

League can be a variable, non deterministic game, like any other game, interaction, event we will have in life. But it doesn't mean it's not predictable/foreseeable/guestimated. It's just that people in general assume these words mean my belief all fall in that event happening. No. I give more weight to that happening. Any other motivate behind the use of those words is misunderstanding or misusing them.

It's possible my fork will dissolve into nothingness while I circle it around the spaghetti. Do I predict that happening? Not in a trillion years.",2021-11-06 21:14:23

EDG lost to 100T which made them seem extremely vulnerable at the end of group stage, at no point they dominated. If you ask me which is the easiest world champion to be at their time it would be EDG, because I feel all top 5 teams could have won the cup in a given day (RNG, DK, T1, GenG, EDG).

But it's a just what-if, EDG is still a good team (a bad team can't become a world champion) and they deserve the win.",2021-11-06 22:15:20

MSI is still the teams that *won* each region.  My point is yes it's not as good as worlds because there's less of a sample, but literally the only thing that your argument poses is that team results vary, which is expected because these are the best players in the world, and unless you're Faker, you won't be winning everything.  Comparing MSI to worlds doesn't automatically mean MSI means nothing, it means that in half a year a lot can change.  IG ran it down the entire LPL summer after the MSI series and *barely* scraped it into worlds, for example, then turned it back on for worlds.  Was the rest of LPL just ""not trying"" in spring when IG beat them?  No, IG was the best team in China along with FPX, and then they weren't, because shit happens.

He wasn't leagues above Smeb or Ssumday or Duke.  He simply had a better team that made it work really well for him in the perfect meta.  They shit on him many, times in Korea, and he got solidly beaten by Koro1 (who was no slouch either), at MSI.  I'm not saying it's because EDG won, I'm saying EDG won because of top and jungle.  I wouldn't even say at worlds he was better than Smeb or Ssumday, it was just SKT being very, very good.  Smeb was a huge reason why the Tigers took a game in finals when SKT was so much better.

as for flandre, xiaohu is a definitive nobrainer as well, he's been consistently strong all year considering how weak RNG was in mid. I also wouldn't say zoom has had a down year, yagao and kanavi fell off a cliff after summer started and he got suffocated in toplane. 

every toplaner this year that's looked good has looked good because they have other lanes to take pressure off them, that's why xiaohu is imo definitive #1. other than that flandre could maybe cut it as top 5 but EDG never received a lot of pressure in toplane because their drew so much pressure in bot and mid. idk but i think i heard a stat from an LPL broadcast that flandre received almost half as much enemy jgl/mid attention as other toplaners while receiving about the same attention as other teams from his own jgl/mid. don't take my word on it tho. flandre has kind of been on an island  and has looked great, but other toplaners that receive more pressure and get less help have looked about/nearly as good (ale, cube, biubiu, etc)",2021-11-07 02:32:32

It is measurably the least important event of the year.",2021-11-06 17:37:15

It just wasn't as clear cut as in spring but he was still an absolute king. Really he's only bad tournament is MSI 2019 and summer 2019 is questionable. But I do not agree with summer 2018.
About Marin I think you're very harsh, yes he might not have been the best at any tournament he entered during his prime, but he was consistently top 2/3 and overalls in 2015 he was the most consistent top laner imo. Duke ssumday and smeb might have peaked higher during that timeframe but Marin apart MSI was consistently going toe to toe with them and never fell. He's a one year wonder, in LPL he was good, like better than most players but he was clearly not as good as before.",2021-11-07 02:45:12

Search reddit after summer for conversation regarding the entirety of summer. Sure, you can search it during summer too, but Nuguri didn't play some of those games because he was subbed out for underperformance! Nuguri was a player going into worlds so there was substantial discussion on his performance in summer, including playoffs, where he failed to do anything meaningful against Flandre.

Look at the comments down there you ignorant prick. I did not link you to useless shits. My point is that people were praising Nuguri to GODLIKE status and it wasnt even close.

What? You indeed know NOTHING ! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAbkbfFhopM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAbkbfFhopM)  


I hate to search up because there are always massive trolls in the comment section of the videos I searched. Take it as it is. Ignore the comments below and just watch the game instead. As you can see Nuguri's Kennen literally carried FPX's ass in that game 3 and along with Lwx's heroics the series didnt end 3-0. FPX was badly outmatched the whole fkin series and it wasnt even close. Taking the piss out of Nuguri is nothing sorts of madness.

No they arent the most consistent top team in the world but worlds is all about showing up and that specific day on that specific series. EDG showed up against DWG and beat then, so they are the best team. Yeah sure, other teams ""dominated and read other teams like a book"" but where were they in the finals aside from Damwon? When teams get to the finals only that series matters, how you get there doesn't matter. Haven't you watched other sports like football or basketball? Sometimes the most talented teams or the teams that have been dominant over the regular season DO NOT win the championship. If you don't win the penultimate series then you aren't the best team in the world and thats facts. You're acting like any team at worlds could just choose to ""show up"" one day and beat Damwon. That isn't the case. Only a few teams can beat damwon and EDG is one of them. Their players can match up with Damwon individually so they always have a chance.",2021-11-07 08:36:47

"Stronger regions care less about MSI allowing weaker teams to overperform at MSI.

Just off the top of my head let's look at the Flash Wolves. They got to semi finals 3 times and quarter finals once at MSI. At worlds they got to quarter finals once, flubbed out in pools twice, and failed to make it to worlds once after placing well at MSI.

The weakest regions (being NA, PCS, and SEA) regions have had 7 Semifinal appearances at MSI, but at worlds have only had one since MSI began. It's fairly obvious how little teams care about MSI, or at the very least how inaccurate of a measurement it is how good a team is.",2021-11-06 18:29:52
