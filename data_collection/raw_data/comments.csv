New reddit has no workaround for some things and is missing basic functionality or has broken features (escaping underscores in URLs with backslashes is fundamentally wrong).

No.  There is often an overreaction to redesigns for that exact reason, but the new design is objectively terrible.  It wastes so much space on the sides for no benefit.  When there are texts posts, I can only see 2.5 posts on the new design, and 10.5 on the old.  Same thing for comments.  Much more busy and significantly less content visible on the screen.

#**DK 3-0 where?**,1636246277.0
"Through these two weeks, there is an interesting thing I observed. 
The post match game thread in which an LPL team won always receive less attention and discussions and praises than the ones in which they lost. 
Of course, there are some people , who will give the excuse that it is expected since LPL is a strong region. However, the notion seem to be contradictory to the comments I observed in the two post match threads that “ EDG WILL GET 3-0 by DK” in the very threads that EDG hard won their matches in two of BO5s during both Semi and Quarter finals. 
And it’s really sad that these type of comments are in a significant proportions. 
As for the other comments, they are either just, plainly downplay’s EDG’s opponents. And almost no one seems to care that EDG is a better team during these match ups. That if EDG won, these people seem to feel that their victory is not hard earned. It is not because EDG plays better it is just that EDG’s opponent are worse, and EDG plays bad.
I hope that this match serves as a wake up call, to all those who have been ridiculing LPL, ridiculing RNG, ridiculing EDG , just because none of your regions’ team made it to the semi finals. You just need to trash talk, degrade, or plainly, to humiliate other region to get your copium and make you feel better.

"What a series, never thought I’d see DK’s topside get gapped lol. The yasuo pick felt kinda troll, and the drafts all around felt weird from DK, trundle did nothing and you could see the hopelessness on canyon’s face, especially when he got killed before that baron fight up in the top lane. 

EDG played out of their minds as heavy underdogs tbh (which is ironic because they’re the first lpl seed). It’s like they saw what gave DK a hard time throughout all their games (only T1 won against them before but still), picked and chose what worked best in each situation and gave their best effort for it. 

Scout’s Zoe or his performance overall, jiejie gapping canyon, viper doing his thing like stomping with aphelios, flandre making khan look amateurish and meiko with the pivotal engages, Jesus Christ. DK looked great in their wins but I guess the 2-1 script buff is too strong. Really nice to go to 5 games tho, silver scrapes is always welcome, and just like the T1 semifinals, final game came down to an elder fight; absolute banger of a series. 

The first time EDG breaks their curse they win worlds, now that’s amazing in all honesty. Going into the finals I was kinda indifferent as to who I’d like to win, predicted 3-1 DK and was accepting that kkoma would get his 4th worlds before faker, with DK realizing a new dynasty for the LCK and khan getting his first international title but EDG came outta nowhere and proved me wrong. 

And that’s the thing: I was already thinking about DK, Khan and kkOma but never once thought about Scout and Meiko’s journey, together with their teammates, and how they just as much deserve a worlds championship as the aforementioned parties. Huge congratulations to EDG for overcoming their demons and breaking the curse, making their efforts all worth it.

Not gonna lie, it was saddening and kinda poignant, to see DK’s players’ faces when they lost, but it is what it is. Having watched gbay99’s documentary on Scout, it all became more poetic for him to win this year imo. It was cool that he even mentioned that with this win against DK he avenged faker, and made me like him more as a player, seeing how he hasn’t forgotten his past experiences in SKT as a rookie etc., and used them to grow as a whole, player/person included (also how he talked about facing many obstacles and not performing at opportune times). Edit: also honorable mention for flandre saying he avenged SofM by beating DK, nice to see these players having good relations with other teams/players

Scout got the Final's MVP and finally performed during a high pressure series!

FPX imploding made C9 get to playoffs.. giving an easy b05 for group D (which ended up being GENG) and helped them make semis (beating expectations)

BIG PROPS to  Viper, after all of the GRF drama he really deserved this  one.  The whole of EDG was sublime, especially Scout who played out of his mind. One hell of a worlds and congratulations again to EDG, now the third most accomplished LOL org ever with this worlds win today.

I'm half joking - cause more than half the times - improved vision was/is actually among the core differences between a win or a loss. The team with less vision (both map vision - and also - quite literally) - it's usually at disadvantage. Big time. That's the main thing i noticed - during this championship... where the players with better vision control - were usually the ones who secured a win for their team.",1636221492.0

"EDG finally got their redemption. They played well and were the stronger team. 

My thoughts: Honestly DK's drafts felt off throughout the series while EDG stuck to comfort. E.g. match 4 I thought DK's trade in the draft was pretty bad: they opened up Lucian and then 'denied' the Lucian/Nami pick and took Nami for themselves with Jhin. Just felt like a really odd 'changeup' and it felt like they didn't get anything especially good in return. I was also seriously questioning the Gwen and Talon pick - EDG's team comp is great at kiting back. Gwen is going to get kited and Talon has no diving buddy. At the end of the draft, EDG had Lucian, Graves, and Zoe - all strong and comfortable picks for EDG while DK was playing a basically new team comp while all of their trading got them a better botlane. Sure ghost and beryl got bottom tower first but that's basically all DK got, conceding mid and top pressure, and every neutral. Match 5, same thing, their draft was extremely questionable while EDG stuck to a standard comp with plenty of comfortable picks. Canyon got the 'counter' on Xin, but he was basically invisible again and blown up immediately in every single fight - and once more he was kited by everyone. Also while Trundle counters Xin, Xin soft counters ranged champions - DK had all ranged damage dealers and Xin escaped multiple times with ulti and only got punished once by the pillar. Meanwhile DK had 0 access to the backline and Aphelios - they were relying on mages to have any sort of threat on Aphelios (how was this ever going to work) which gets outscaled and are going to be more unreliable threats. So tl;dr for the last match; DK pick all ranged immobile damage dealers against Xin (counters ranged damage dealers) and Kennen (great against immobile squishies). DK had no way to kite, had no ability to kill Aphelios, and the cherry on top is that Scout got another Zoe game in. It wasn't hard to predict how this went given that EDG had been reaching the mid game without many problems against DK.",1636276852.0

especially on the pick ban of g5 where edg did a t1 style g5 draft but didn't last pick support but instead picked a teamfighting supp early then the deny pick on zoe to disrupt the wombo with ziggs lastly giving them the opportunity to pick xz vs a team that relied on long range damage
wp edg wp best finals in years scout was disgusting on zoe",1636219009.0
it’s easy to pick on khan but the ziggs pick was bad. no satchel procs and no consistent dps in team fights. He was the last alive in muliplte team fights when he could have 1v2 on an atk speed ad. Sadge jhin was open btw,1636219014.0

Either send Syndra with TP bot to push, or have Khan hard commit to the split. Either they answer it and it's a free drag, plus mid turret, or since you have a Ziggs mid, just ignore Soul and destroy their base, and maybe send Leo and Trundle drag to try and steal/stop backs.

That Baron should've guaranteed drag and river position, but instead they never pushed past river, conceded position, and played like they hadn't just snuck Baron.

They either needed Showmaker pushing out bot, since he had TP and everyone else was mid, no wards or anything to threaten him, or Khan needed to push that huge wave past the river and start threatening turrets during the dragon countdown, not go mid like he was pushing a normal wave. 

&#x200B;

Regardless, the moment EDG had river position with a full summ Kennen sitting in base, the right decision was to hard push and send supp and jg to try to steal and interrupt backs. Ziggs could even do that WHILE pushing w/ ult. If Kennen committed to that TP, DW could've outright won the game if they stopped backs, or at least put themselves in a massive macro advantage. Regardless, they chose THE WORST possible situation possible, and it cost them the game.

&#x200B;

I don't know what it is with Korean teams and how they play dragon. I remember KT chunked out Xayah right as Infernal was spawning with the whole team mid, THEN LET HIM BACK AND GAVE iG POSITION ON WHAT WAS A OTHERWISE GUARANTEED DRAGON!

I assure you if the semis was flipped and it was DK who win GenG, EDG who won T1. T1 fans would be rooting for DK instead, because in this case EDG ""denied T1's chance to win another world championship"". Ironic ain't it. Funny who T1 fans was calling for EDG to ""avenge/revenge for T1"" when they are literally a LPL team and one who has always rivalled T1 in internationals in the past/worlds (Even before ""SKT"" Scout's addition).

&#x200B;

And as for the Showmaker ""smug"" it was a joke and him having fun, too sad that fans this generation can't take jokes. I'm sure other players have this moment too, but why was it not mentioned? Because teams seldom kicked T1 out of contention, in the case DK did.

Today, World's Finals, the most important stream of the season and year I was a victim of him for no reason. Got banned just because he had an error with a player and chat was just letting him know. He got really mad and since the delay he just though my comments were just to bully him. My comment: ""Scout???"". BOOM. PERMA BANNED. 

So after being subbed and supporting him for two years he just blindly ban everyone just because he doesn't like to be corrected and thinks he's always right. He ruined the stream for me. He ruined the season. That's it for me with Dom. I don't know if it's the money or his success but he had change, or was always like this, I don't know.

"Wtf was DW doing? They contested soul like they DIDN'T have Baron. Why the fuck was Khan pushing bot with no TP, rather than Syndra who had it? Let Syndra push and establish position for drag while still potentially regrouping, or have Khan hard push (they were in NO POSITION to collapse), forcing them to answer for free drag. Since they didn't decide that however, THEY ABANDONED THEIR HUGE MID WAVE TO CONTEST DRAG LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE BARON.

Seriously, let Khan keep pushing bot, let Ziggs keep pushing mid, and EDG is  fucked. Khan had no reason to group up, because if they go to answer his push, they get drag. Even after, he grouped up, they had 5 seconds and a huge wave mid while EDG had prio for drag. HAVE KHAN AND ZIGGS KEEP PUSHING. Who gives a shit if they get soul, they already made the wrong choice, and between Leo, Syndra, Trundle, and a Ziggs ult, they're gonna have a REAL hard time backing to save the base. 5 seconds for spawn, like 3 seconds to kill, and 8 seconds to recall. A Ziggs and Graves w/ a huge Baron wave vs a Kennen (who might've TP'd anyways) is going to give do MASSIVE damage to the base, and if they just stop recalls for 12 secs, they probably win. If not, doesn't matter if the rest of the team dies sacrificing themselves, they can't counterpush in time. Worst case scenario, and I do mean absolutely worse case, 3 deaths, and soul in exchange for an inhib. Best case scenario, they outright win. The proper decision would've been either Syndra bot with TP to join, or Khan keep pushing, forcing them to answer his split with more than one while they get drag.

&#x200B;

DW played that soul contest like they didn't have Baron, and that cost them the game. There was no guarantee they won that team fight, or the game on the Baron push, but there was a guarantee they at least would've secured a MASSIVE macro advantage at the cost of soul.

I think flandre graves ulting the small raptors while Canyon was taking them sums up that game nicely,1636231269.0

Jiejie actual smite god,1636238662.0
"I said it in groups and I'll say it again.  If you pick Talon jungle, you deserve to lose.",1636247668.0
"one has to recognize that canyon(or DK has a whole, we dont know) actually just trolled the entire team there by choosing to for an impossible bot dive instead of taking a free *infernal* drag(should be the choice every time, even if chance for succesful bot dive is 50% or higher), that wrong decision alone seriously swung the whole game in EDGs favor",1636289572.0
"??? Game 4 had nothing to do with JieJie running Canyon. Canyon actually played as you should in that scenario camping bot because top is an impossible gank with 0 cc vs a graves, and mid extremely hard vs a Zoe and easier to get counterganked and double killed if Xin zhao is nearby.

The problem was not how Canyon played but the pick itself. Talon (Poppy as well) are the most overrated junglers of the entire tournament.

Game 5 kennen got back because this tournament every team contest herald which is the most overrated objective even when they shouldnt. So imo its not worth at all to drop 300 g in a fight you are gonna lose vs Rakan/Xin zhao only to share some plating later. Hell DWG had some games in which the adc loses 2 waves and gives 2 platings for free just because he went to get herald. How is that even worth in the slightest.

JieJie didnt play bad but wasnt amazing either. Meiko on the other hand was the most consistent player of the series imo and worth MVP. Flandre and Viper played also pretty well and Scout just got carried in a lot of games. He barely could land bubbles it was painful if you compare him to BDD which actually knew how to Zoe spam. But in the end the series got decided by DWG getting outdrafted harder. Specially game 5 DWG comp really had no synergy at all and Aphelios could just run wild specially with some items.",1636251219.0

EDG was a match for DW's teamfighting, and outside a sneaky Baron play, they didn't look for other ways to win BESIDES fighting (they even wasted Baron grouping mid and fighting like Silvers). They didn't utilize their advantages like they should have, and played right into EDG's strengths. Normally, this would still win, but Canyon didn't do his job.",1636232675.0

[removed],1636229414.0
Ziggs is super oppressive if you can get ahead.  You can have your support roam and make plays while he farms under tower.  That opens up opportunity to get a lead and then you just have Ziggs push down towers to get more gold and accelerate ahead.  Problem is DWG never got a lead in game 5.  It is one of the champions where sometimes it looks like it is impossible to win against and other times looks like it is impossible to win with.,1636219389.0
"Ziggs is mainly good for zone control/wave clear and poking out squishies (the turret thing sometimes I guess). Essentially gaining a hp advantage in a given situation.

This worked against T1 because their team (both team's comps) allowed for it, but it was evident from game 1 that the lack of an adc's constant dps pressure was a major weak point against EDG.

I was confused as to why they didn't make Zoe a priority for Showmaker if they wanted to run Ziggs. You kinda need to go all in on a hard poke comp. You also need an appropriate follow-up to clean up who you've chunked out.

Though while I am unhappy with a few of DWK's drafts (would rather watch both teams at full potential duke it out than having DWK weakening their comp with a weird pick), this was such a fun series to watch.",1636221810.0

Explain to me why people would think after semi finals that theses teams where on the same level? Dawmong wasn't just strong, they looked INCREDIBLY dominant, something we didn't saw for years now.

This is probably the least diverse worlds in History, only 63 unique picks & bans across the 29 games of Quarters + Semis + Finals. About 40% of the champion pool even worth touching, and a good chunk of those 63 champs were picked like once or banned and never picked at all. The top 8 teams in the world are only interested in dealing with 40% of the champ pool, the remaining 60% is that un-meta and unpickable. No counterpicks, no individual good enough at one champion to draw a ban.

I still think some people were a bit optimistic about the LPL. FPX shit the bed in groups and LNG just wasn’t good enough to make it out. EDG and RNG are world class teams but IMO Korea was still better this time. Not by a huge margin but still. Anyone who predicted DK 3-0 is an idiot though.,1636218675.0
"LCK still has significantly more talent than any other region. No one is importing LPL players and the only LPL teams to win worlds were 40% Korean. Not downplaying the Chinese players on EDG this year, I think each of them played a major factor in their win unlike IG's win, but when 17 of the final 20 players are Korean, it's pretty obvious where all the talent is. Sure LPL can buy top Korean talent, but they will really struggle to develop young talent with the new gaming bans and they had a large talent gap to begin with. Hell even SofM was an import for Suning and he was their main carry.

If we're talking ability to form teams and coaching ability LPL is certainly not overrated (especially with how hard DWG got draft gapped each game), but the region's talent gap is pretty large compared to Korea.

If we're talking availability of homegrown talent, LPL is overrated as fuck. If EU committed to Korean talent as hard as China has to fill in gaps, they would overtake the LPL by a mile.",1636218766.0

As great as he is, as cracked as he is, even though he played out of his mind this series, I find it hard to give Scout that much credit when you look at the pieces he was playing with.

And I think most people at \*\*worst\*\* would put Viper top 3 ADC in the world. I think I'm being too generous here too. I think most people wouldn't put Viper below top 2, but that's besides the point.

">free summoners from minions are a mistake

Spell Shards are not free. Zoe earns each and every Spell Shard that she gets.

She can collect Spell Shards one of two ways: first, by waiting the arrival for a minion with a balloon (less than one per wave), successful delivering the last hit on said minion, then going over to collect the Shard; or second, by one dropping from someone on the enemy team, and then going over to collect the Shard. The Spell Shard is right there on the ground for everyone to see. Going over to it sets Zoe up for the enemy team's crowd-control, area-denial, skill-shots, point-and-click abilities, and even their basic attacks. It's basically a beacon that says ""Zoe will try to collect this. Punish her for it!""

Please take note of that second way of collecting Shards. Enemies drop them by casting Summoner Spells or triggering item-actives. That means that by simply not using those while Zoe is around, the enemy team can deny Zoe a lot of her potential power. I doubt there is another Champion in the game whose power is so closely linked to the actions of the enemy team. And here's something to consider: Summoner Spells and item-actives are just about the only actions that are truly only in the player's control. There are abilities that force you to move, force you to attack, force you to keep still, but no one can force you to use those. If Zoe collected a Spell Shard from you, it means not only did you trigger your ability while she was near enough to get it, you also did it in a place that was safe for her to collect it, and no one on your team stopped her from collecting it.

So what does Zoe get for her efforts? One cast of Spell Thief. Think about that for a moment. Bard collects randomly spawning Chimes (that he doesn't need to make spawn, nor can they be withheld by the enemy), and when he does, he gains experience and empowers his Meeps. Collecting his randomly spawning collectible makes him scale. And don't get me started on Thresh. Randomly spawning souls grant him Ability Power, Armor, Shield strength, and damage on his Flay ability. This is on top of fact that these will spawn simply from things dying near Thresh (while Zoe needs to last-hit her minions), cannot be seen by enemies unless they have vision of Thresh, and most amusing of all, they can be collected by his Lantern. Zoe's collectible, which must be earned by her directly and can be withheld by enemies, grants her one cast of an ability, while Champions who have an easier time gathering their collectibles get to scale.

And by the way, they get to do this... without sacrificing an ability slot! Spell Thief already has a greater price than most Champions can imagine: having a ""W"" ability. Let's consider, for example, Yasuo: another Champion with a very powerful ""W"" ability. Imagine if suddenly Yasuo players were told that, in order to cast your ""W"", you will first have to earn the right to cast it by collecting a drop, then you have to use it within the next minute or it'll go to waste, you're not allowed to stack multiple of them, which means you'll have to go through this each and every time you want to use this ability, and in the meantime, this slot is effectively empty. They would go into shock. But that's Zoe's reality.

"Can't really disagree with that either, haha. But hey, that's what makes this team so awesome. No obvious weak link, they all played really well. Sometimes specific players really stood out, other times they were ""just"" good. But they're so fun to watch, especially when they're playing so confident. How Meiko was just wandering around the enemy jungle, basically surrounded by 5 enemies. warding and removing vision. The way Viper really took off on Lucian with the Lulu buffs and how he kept dashing/flashing forward, that positioning! How Flandre can farm and farm and then suddenly it's ""oops, wtf, he's level 18??"" JieJie with his private lessons from Clid on how to never lose smite fights.  And Scout, who never really gets talked about much when people talk about the best midlaners in the world.. Even after his phenomenal showing in 2018 (Caps who? :D) people kinda ignored that due to their defeat. It's always Showmaker this, Chovy that, Rookie, Faker, etc. He finally showed them! And I have to say one of the greatest parts of this entire series was how they managed to completely kill off Canyon's Talon. He didn't stand a chance. It was such a great team effort. At end game there, Canyon was level 13 and Flandre was 18 on his Graves. Poor Canyon, but I loved how they managed to do that.

Can't really put into words why, but I always felt the LPL had such amazing playstyle. Even during the SKT era, I never really liked the slow macro playstyle. I mean, it was super good, super surgical and impossible to play against right? But it's just so much less fun to watch. The explosive LPL style was always a joy to watch. But what EDG does shows such an understanding of macro play, their vision, jungle pathing, teamfight positioning, I love all of it. And I couldn't be happier that they finally showed what they're capable of. They were always good, they always had high ceilings, but it never showed at Worlds. FINALLY. EDG EDG EDG!

It's not like the toxic rivalry started this worlds, it's been there on both sides (+ bandwagoners who still prefer EU/NA first) ever since it became a real rivalry with LPL winning 2018 and 2019. But then even after Damwon emerged to win 2020 the talk was still just about LCK being a one team region while LPL gets hyped as having all their top 4+ teams capable of winning worlds lmao. Not that the MSI results and how fast new teams+players emerge (and burn out) in China help with that, but sheesh. Does it have to be repeated everywhere and for any other LCK team but also Damwon themselves even? And why is people underrating EDG going into this based on their games before this different from people underrating LCK as a whole before Worlds?

It's like not even winning Worlds will shut up the people who are so into supporting the new ""best region"" they just want to shit on everyone else, or other region fans who want to bring the LCK down to their level. Exactly why I am not looking forward to following anything until MSI or Worlds + Asian Games next year might change things again.

But considering this Worlds result with LCK being the ones having 3 teams in semis and cannibalizing each other to lose 2-3 in finals vs LPL in 2020 having 2 teams in semis and cannibalizing each other to lose 1-3 in finals, LPL is the one team region now and LCK is still stronger as whole, right?

I don't want to harp on people for predicting wrong, but when it comes to predictions, you must consider the intangibles, think outside the box.

I mean some people saw EDG's ceiling, and knew they had a chance of reaching a ceiling that is higher than DK.

Some people saw how EDG plays better when they are underdogs, and chokes vs teams perceived as ""weaker"", as shown in LPL and in the GenG series where people predicted 3-1 EDG (on average).

Some people saw EDG as a team that play extremely well as a unit, and have a wide champion pool, both of these are not easily replicated.

WE was super popular at the time because it's an old club and they had China's best results at the time, going on a massive win streak, winning many tournaments both domestic and international, and winning IPL 5.  Eventually they declined and Misaya retired, and Clearlove + Fzzf were basically always fighting with Caomei and Weixiao (their most popular player and considered to be the best ADC in the world before Uzi and Namei).  Coach Aaron, who was important enough to have even gone with them to take their trophy on stage at IPL5, took Clearlove and Fzzf with them to form EDG, and took Namei, who by that time was China's best ADC and probably the world's, who just carried his shitter team to an LPL championship.  He got a lot of hate too, I'm not sure why, but maybe because his team, PE, was originally WE's sister team.  Namei is one of three players who's gotten 3 LPL titles in a row (Clearlove and Koro1), and the only player to have gotten 4 finals in a row and still has more titles than any other ADC, so that pickup was *huge* for them.

"Giving EDG and the LPL a free pass for their disappointing group stage and phrase it as “ more time to understand the meta” is a stupid thing to take away from this series. FPX crashed and burned, LNG got gapped, and RNG ran out of steam. 

EDG won because they had a great read on DK’s gameplan regardless of the meta. The meta that we saw in Semis-Finals is different from what we had on group stage with emphasis on stabilizing toplane and control mage prio. Funnily enough, the Zilean pick would not be such a high prio pick if it werent for Keria in the DK vs T1 series, which exposed DK, so you can thank T1 for doing so.",1636222166.0

Tryndamere turned out to be somewhat of a flop, and they removed a lot of power from Lucian mid. After that we get things like Graves mid, who I don't know if Worlds mid laners were playing (he feels pretty sad into mages anyway), Tristana (extremely hard countered by Syndra), and a bunch of AD assassins that lose a lot of agency after 15 minutes in competitive play.

Even though Magic pen is strong, going double AP mid/jg makes the 2v2 harder since both other mid/jg will have more MR (namely Merc Treads) which makes your damage take a lot longer to come online.

Maybe.  You *can* judge League of Legends play based on simply how a team looks, despite the opposition.  I didn't think Khan or Canyon looked nearly as good in a vaccuum.  But I'm not an expert analyst, either.

> Also it's kind of weird to say ""if they played better they would win"".

This is oversimplified.  I'm referring to playing to the level we've already seen, and recently.  It's not like saying: ""If Team Liquid had just played better than they ever have before, they can beat anybody!"".  I'm specifically talking about playing to the level they were literally just playing at.

2021 is the weird one. We're in a general era of LPL dominance, even if it isn't as consistent as the era of LCK dominance. Damwon had roster changes since their worlds win, and failed to win MSI. They hadn't matched up against any LPL teams at worlds aside from a collapsing FPX that had also lost to Rogue and C9. Their quarter and semi final matchups were against an EU team that they'd already beaten at MSI, and the 3rd place team from their own league.

Your toplaner will now either have to adapt to those resources being given to someone else, or fail

Your midlaner will have to adapt to agressive/carry-focused play

You are cherry picking some mentalities that to me, make little to no sense. 

I would, and in my mind, I predicted a 3-0 for DWG. Based on performance from both teams. I watch the games, I understand the game, I can make some rational judgement on what will happen. That's one of the cores of what makes a Human, Human. Assuming, Judging, expecting something to happen based on past results. I expect my spaghetti to be rolled in the fork, if I've done it a thousand times. There's a lot to say about cognitiveness, physics bla bla bla, but it's engrained in us that intelligence isn't some magical stuff, it's knowing and rationalizing stuff out. Anyway....

The cherry picking hypothetical sentences on both scenarios, to me it's borderline people who are basing their predictions on emotions. Which is 100% valid. But it's up to you, me, and everyone to make a clear distinction weather it's a rational or emotional prediction. In doubt, ask why that prediction.

Most predictions are based on emotions here at Reddit. Want to break that cicle? A strengths and weaknesses thread of both teams is always appreciated. There are sometimes a few by very smart people who make strong arguments (in my eyes), and they are enjoyable to see. It gives, at least to me, a moment to learn, and insights into changing how I play, how I watch the game and how I predict results.

In what context? Because I would argue quite the opposite. The only team to have consistent results at MSI with worlds has been SKT.

SKT in 2015 got 2nd at MSI but won worlds. In 2016 they won both MSI and worlds. In 2017 SKT won MSI but got 2nd at worlds, losing to a team that didn't even make it to MSI.

In 2018 RNG won MSI but failed to make semis.

In 2019 Liquid got 2nd at MSI but didn't make it out of groups, and G2 won MSI but got 2nd.

2021 RNG once again won MSI but failed to make semis.

MSI has had 7 top 4s from the NA, PCS, and SEA regions. At worlds it has only happened once (cloud9 in 2019) since MSI started.

The Flash Wolves have had massive success at MSI making it to Semifinals 3 times and Quarterfinals once, but at worlds have only made it to quarterfinals once and either flubbed out in groups or didn't even make it to worlds after performing fantastic at MSI.

"Everything is discussed.

Except for where you think league is a variable game. Everything is. The fork might break, weaken itself. There variables are less changing and way less dynamic. It does not mean you can't predict something with it. Even the amount of spaghetti strings.

League is indeed dynamic. Like everything else in this world. I've a degree in Statistics, I do know what I'm talking about here.

My whole education converges to Data Science tho. We can have systems that have high orders of complexity, and still make some solid educated guessing. Read, educated guessing, which to the generic folk, it's ""prediction"".

We can argue if knowing all the variables, the system outcome is deterministic or not. (Hint: unless all our current theory on Quantum Mechanics is wrong and we need a new Einstein or Feynman, no system is deterministic). But, the statistical significance of these non deterministic variances is arguably null in the grand scheme of, let's say, a League of Legends game.

I may have to do guessing on whether a player will kill a creep on 3:33 or 3:34, due to the probabilistic nature of reality, but there are strong beliefs that that slight difference will have little impact.

It's the same as expecting that an absurd amount of these slight changes results in my coffee shop down the road team will win vs Real Madrid.

Here, in this case, the match up was more evenly matched. Yet, League has developed enough for good Human scouting and judging. Imagine then what algorithms can spit out in terms of performance and quality. They ""see"" shit we can't even dream of.

Of course these algorithms are rudimentary since they don't, 1) account for player mood; 2) player history to the adversary; 3) any other human related factor that doesn't involve the ""League of legends"" domain. (See case: Bwipo); 4) account for interactions between different players (We are going into psychology levels here. Want a good guess or know about this? Talk with Casting people for reality shows, check their backgrounds); 5) Player styles; 6) Many other little things.

Nowadays these little algorithms look at what they can get, but I think currently, humans who know the shit they are talking about (Casters, analysts, LS etc etc) are the best guestimates/predictions we can have before a game.

League can be a variable, non deterministic game, like any other game, interaction, event we will have in life. But it doesn't mean it's not predictable/foreseeable/guestimated. It's just that people in general assume these words mean my belief all fall in that event happening. No. I give more weight to that happening. Any other motivate behind the use of those words is misunderstanding or misusing them.

It's possible my fork will dissolve into nothingness while I circle it around the spaghetti. Do I predict that happening? Not in a trillion years.",1636233263.0

EDG lost to 100T which made them seem extremely vulnerable at the end of group stage, at no point they dominated. If you ask me which is the easiest world champion to be at their time it would be EDG, because I feel all top 5 teams could have won the cup in a given day (RNG, DK, T1, GenG, EDG).

But it's a just what-if, EDG is still a good team (a bad team can't become a world champion) and they deserve the win.",1636236920.0

MSI is still the teams that *won* each region.  My point is yes it's not as good as worlds because there's less of a sample, but literally the only thing that your argument poses is that team results vary, which is expected because these are the best players in the world, and unless you're Faker, you won't be winning everything.  Comparing MSI to worlds doesn't automatically mean MSI means nothing, it means that in half a year a lot can change.  IG ran it down the entire LPL summer after the MSI series and *barely* scraped it into worlds, for example, then turned it back on for worlds.  Was the rest of LPL just ""not trying"" in spring when IG beat them?  No, IG was the best team in China along with FPX, and then they weren't, because shit happens.

He wasn't leagues above Smeb or Ssumday or Duke.  He simply had a better team that made it work really well for him in the perfect meta.

I wouldn't even say at worlds he was better than Smeb or Ssumday, it was just SKT being very, very good.  Smeb was a huge reason why the Tigers took a game in finals when SKT was so much better.

as for flandre, xiaohu is a definitive nobrainer as well, he's been consistently strong all year considering how weak RNG was in mid. I also wouldn't say zoom has had a down year, yagao and kanavi fell off a cliff after summer started and he got suffocated in toplane. 

every toplaner this year that's looked good has looked good because they have other lanes to take pressure off them, that's why xiaohu is imo definitive #1. other than that flandre could maybe cut it as top 5 but EDG never received a lot of pressure in toplane because their drew so much pressure in bot and mid. idk but i think i heard a stat from an LPL broadcast that flandre received almost half as much enemy jgl/mid attention as other toplaners while receiving about the same attention as other teams from his own jgl/mid. don't take my word on it tho. flandre has kind of been on an island  and has looked great, but other toplaners that receive more pressure and get less help have looked about/nearly as good (ale, cube, biubiu, etc)",1636252352.0

About Marin I think you're very harsh, yes he might not have been the best at any tournament he entered during his prime, but he was consistently top 2/3 and overalls in 2015 he was the most consistent top laner imo. Duke ssumday and smeb might have peaked higher during that timeframe but Marin apart MSI was consistently going toe to toe with them and never fell. He's a one year wonder, in LPL he was good, like better than most players but he was clearly not as good as before.",1636253112.0

"I don't know if you struggle with the English language or are just deliberately obtuse.

You link games against only 8917, quite literally THE worst performing top in LPL summer who almost everyone was top diffing all split long, as your argument that Nuguri has had a great year? You *cannot* be serious. Honestly.

Search reddit after summer for conversation regarding the entirety of summer. Sure, you can search it during summer too, but Nuguri didn't play some of those games because he was subbed out for underperformance! Nuguri was a player going into worlds so there was substantial discussion on his performance in summer, including playoffs, where he failed to do anything meaningful against Flandre.

"I definitely agree on TheShy in both spring seasons being far and away the best top in the world, I guess I forgot to mention that part.  The not very good part I meant more by his standards which is my wording isssue: still solid, but was a bit reckless and not nearly the same as we saw both spring seasons, and not necessarily the best top in China during the time, compared to someone like Zoom for example.  I think Marin was good, but a lot of that consistency was because of his team IMO.",1636259362.0

Look at the comments down there you ignorant prick. I did not link you to useless shits. My point is that people were praising Nuguri to GODLIKE status and it wasnt even close. That was my arguement or do you need FURTHER evidence? Cuz I got tons of them ready on my bookmark as I got loads of people to unleash them on, now that the bandwagoning period is over.

What? You indeed know NOTHING ! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAbkbfFhopM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAbkbfFhopM)  


I hate to search up because there are always massive trolls in the comment section of the videos I searched. Take it as it is. Ignore the comments below and just watch the game instead. As you can see Nuguri's Kennen literally carried FPX's ass in that game 3 and along with Lwx's heroics the series didnt end 3-0. FPX was badly outmatched the whole fkin series and it wasnt even close. Taking the piss out of Nuguri is nothing sorts of madness.

Because you disagreed after everything is said and done. Thats not good spirit man Im just calling you out. Fkin hell take a clue or are you dumber than an anime MC? You didnt disrespect my opinion. Im just saying that you SHOULD be respecting my opinion. Is it hard to understand?

Absurd stupidity. You are asking for ""good English"" in a LCK vs LPL postmatch thread... In a sub whose majority is EU... Fkin hell is this some next level troll shit?

"I definitely can say EDG is the best team in the world because they won worlds. No they arent the most consistent top team in the world but worlds is all about showing up and that specific day on that specific series. EDG showed up against DWG and beat then, so they are the best team. Yeah sure, other teams ""dominated and read other teams like a book"" but where were they in the finals aside from Damwon? When teams get to the finals only that series matters, how you get there doesn't matter. Haven't you watched other sports like football or basketball? Sometimes the most talented teams or the teams that have been dominant over the regular season DO NOT win the championship. If you don't win the penultimate series then you aren't the best team in the world and thats facts. You're acting like any team at worlds could just choose to ""show up"" one day and beat Damwon. That isn't the case. Only a few teams can beat damwon and EDG is one of them. Their players can match up with Damwon individually so they always have a chance.",1636274207.0

"Stronger regions care less about MSI allowing weaker teams to overperform at MSI.

Just off the top of my head let's look at the Flash Wolves. They got to semi finals 3 times and quarter finals once at MSI. At worlds they got to quarter finals once, flubbed out in pools twice, and failed to make it to worlds once after placing well at MSI.

The weakest regions (being NA, PCS, and SEA) regions have had 7 Semifinal appearances at MSI, but at worlds have only had one since MSI began. It's fairly obvious how little teams care about MSI, or at the very least how inaccurate of a measurement it is how good a team is.",1636223392.0

There’s four spots in semis and only three strong region teams lmao. Do you just not know how msi works, or math in general actually? There isn’t a quarterfinals at msi, only semis and finals. Flash wolves didn’t overperform at msi to make semis three times. They just had to be better than the na team which they naturally were most of the time.
